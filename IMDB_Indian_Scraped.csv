Each story follows a character leading an incomplete life and seeking something - love, bodily pleasures, refuge or just closure - a man who is ashamed of being a prostitute's son and has an awakening in a place he detests the most; a 69 year old who is unapologetic about his sexual desires and refuses to be shamed by the society; a jilted lover who comes to terms with reality and decides to start a new chapter in his life; an 18 year old eager to lose his virginity before he gives up all sexual pleasures in life; a conman who makes a living out of robbing people but gets robbed of something deeply precious instead. Though they feature in distinct stories, each of these characters visit a brothel for the first time in their lives and eventually find wisdom and solace with sex workers. Their experiences may range from sensual to provocative, but irrespective of that, a single night ends up changing their outlook forever. The show is produced by Anil V Kumar Productions in association with Hungama Digital Media, and all episodes have been directed by Anil V Kumar.

To escape the harsh reality of their world, its people seek refuge in the fantastical world of cinema. This passion for cinema has spurred a group of cinema enthusiasts to make their own films-quirky, low budget, socially aware and notoriously funny spoofs of Bollywood films. Their ambition has grown and now they are ready to take on Hollywood and Superman. We follow them on this journey. At times funny, tragic, contemplative. Always warm and engaging. And as the film begins to take shape, through schemes and approaches that are sublimely ingenious, simply bizarre and purely hysterical, we also slowly discover Malegaon itself. A microcosm that embodies and reflects the complexities of modern small town India. Where the modern and the traditional rub shoulders, where extreme poverty and extreme wealth are neighbours, bewildering in its diversity, trapped in self-made destinies, with a spirit that can never be vanquished.
