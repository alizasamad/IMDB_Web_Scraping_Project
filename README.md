# Top 1500 Hindi Movies (IMDB)

## Project Description:
Through web-scraping, I have compiled the top 1500 Hindi Movies and TV Series on IMDB into a table. I utilized Python's Beautiful Soup and Selenium libraries to accomplish my goal. Beautiful Soup Version 4 is used to parse the HTML code. Instead of using the Requests library, I used Selenium since my program had to manually scroll through IMDB's site and populate the desired 1500 items (the default is 50 items per page). 

This repository currently contains the final code and CSV file. I will be adding a full project blog soon with my previous attempts and a breakdown of how I achieved the final result. Stay tuned for more updates!
